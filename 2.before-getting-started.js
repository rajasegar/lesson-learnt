1. Forget jQuery (I didnt mean not to use jQuery) (jQuery is DOM/Event Based and Ember is State Based)

2. No such thing called "Best practices", call it as "EMBER WAY"

3. Forget Procedural way of writing code


Things you should know before Ember:-
1. ES6 (Class, extend vs create, destructuring, Default values, Arrow operator, Promise(RSVP), let and const)
