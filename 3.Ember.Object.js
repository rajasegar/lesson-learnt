Ember Object:-

-- Ember.Object is the main base class for all Ember objects (Component, Router, Mixin what not..)
-- provides class system
-- mixins

Example:-
let Person = Ember.Object.extend({});

Points to noted:-
1. JS Object vs Ember.Object
1. extend vs create


Example:-

1. Ember.Mixin.create
2. Ember.Component.extend / Router.create
